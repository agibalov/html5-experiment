* [ng2-dragula](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula) relies on [Dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula). ng2-dragula 1.5.0 doesn't play well with Angular 5.2.0 - see valor-software/ng2-dragula#813. While one-column drag-and-drops work fine, you can't move items from one column to another.
* [ng-drag-drop](https://github.com/ObaidUrRehman/ng-drag-drop) relies on HTML5 APIs and doesn't provide item reordering. Works fine, though.
* [ngx-dnd](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-dnd) relies on [Dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula). Works.
