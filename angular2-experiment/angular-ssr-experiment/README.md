# angular-ssr-experiment

Learning Angular server-side rendering.

* `yarn start` to launch BE and FE in dev mode (no SSR)
* `yarn build:ssr && yarn serve:ssr` to build and launch in SSR-enabled mode. Try entirely disabling JavaScript to see how it works in "static HTML" mode (in Chrome dev console, Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Disable JavaScript" to disable JavaScript).
