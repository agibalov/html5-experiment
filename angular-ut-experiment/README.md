### New

This doesn't seem to require global Karma:
```
npm install
grunt test // for a single test run
grunt watch // to continuously run the tests
```

### Old

Before running, install `karma-cli` globally:
```
npm install -g karma-cli
```
And sure do `npm install` and `bower install`. Then, to run tests one time:
```
npm run test-single-run
```
To continuously run tests:
```
npm test
```
